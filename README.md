## Creating a new article
Articles should be placed in `./articles/article_name` the directory should contain two folders: 1.) markdown file with the article contents, and 2.) yaml file with the metadata. A sample yaml file should like like the following

```
title: "Study of ocean currents with physicalized models for interactive querying"
description: "A discussion on the growing field of physicalization, and its impact on tangible querying of geophysical data like ocean currents by seeding streamlines"

```

So the file structure is

```
articles
└── sample_article
    ├── sample_article/sample_article.md
    └── articles/sample_article/sample_article.yml
```
