        Cloth Simulation Using Numerical Integration: Fans

    <p>
        With this project, we implement a cloth simulation using the midpoint integration technique. The cloth is first defined
        using a series of springs connected in a grid, and then using Hooke's law and numerical integration, we update the position
        and velocity of the cloth at each time step. However, in a vacuum, cloth does not behave very interestingly, so we implemented
        air drag and sphere-based collision detection. At the end, we'll introduce our attempt at collision detection on more complex meshes
        using a node-triangle intersection algorithm, and an octree to reduce computation.

        Controls
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To orbit the camera, use the arrow keys.</li>
        <li>To interact with the cloth, click and drag around it and a fan will appear</li>
        <li>Reset the animation using the 'R' key</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        User Interaction
    </h3>
    <p>
        We wanted a way for the user to interact with the cloth, and we wanted it to feel playful.
        Since we had an implementation for air drag on the cloth, and a robust collision detection system,
        we decided we'd let users click on the screen to cast a fan into the 3D space that would adjust the
        "wind" direction. To help users visualize the direction of wind, we spawn a particle emitter at the fan's
        location and blow dust particles in the "wind" direction.

    <h3>
        Simulating Cloth
    </h3>
    <p>
        The cloth can be modeled as a collection of interconnected springs, and we track the nodes where the springs
        connect. For each node, we have a velocity and a position attribute. Using numerical integration (the midpoint method),
        we can estimate the continuous updates in the positions of each node using a discrete technique. For each frame, we can then define the number of time steps we would like to take, or the number of discrete updates per frame. The cloth class is flexible, making it easy for us to add more nodes, change the size, stretch, and color.
