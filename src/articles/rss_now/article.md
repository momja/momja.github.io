# This Blog is now available via RSS!
I took some time this weekend to add an RSS feed to this blog. I will eventually add a visible link, but for now, you can find it at [dizzard.net/rss](https://dizzard.net/rss). It may have some kinks to work out, but the solution was quick and dirty. I implemented it using [Feedgen](https://pypi.org/project/feedgen/). Like most of my personal projects these days, ChatGPT sped up the process significantly.
