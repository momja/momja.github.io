Queue “I’ll be watching you” by The Police, because I’m now spying on all the viewers of this blog!

Just kidding. Well, sort of. I wanted to have some metric of how many people are viewing my blog, not because I’m going to sell ad space, or leverage that information for some other malicious reason. I just wanted to know if anyone reads it! And like I said, to respect my readers’ privacy, I wanted to take as little data as possible. That’s why I decided to use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/). It keeps a count of when someone’s checking out my site, but it’s not tracking all the personal data that google analytics is going to.

It was super easy to set up, you can inspect this page and see the script yourself. It’s just one line :).
