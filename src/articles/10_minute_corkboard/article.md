# 10 Minute Mini Corkboard Enamel Pin Display
I was waiting for paint to dry, so to keep my hands busy I made this little cork board to display some of my and my partner's pins (yeah I know, it's pretty empty as-is). It's just cork adhered to a hardboard backing. I cut it out on the bandsaw.

Some related links I found:
- Cork, by all accounts I have found from 5 minutes of searching, is a pretty sustainable material [link](https://earthfriendlytips.com/is-cork-eco-friendly-everything-you-need-to-know/)
- Cork is also derived from the bark of the [Quercus Suber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_suber) tree, which is a type of Oak tree!
- Harvesting the cork does not require cutting down the tree. The bark is removed, and the tree remains to continue growing
- Interesting Business Insider video on Cork Production in Portugal, the biggest producer of cork.
