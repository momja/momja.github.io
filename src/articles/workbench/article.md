# Finished a Workbench
I just finished constructing a workbench for [Sequoia Fabrica's](https://sequoiafabrica.org) woodshop. I'm fairly happy with it, it's one of my first large-scale projects. The table top was a challenge to assemble because it was all construction lumber. Working around knots and laminating all the boards together was really tough, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

## Design
The workbench is designed to hold 3 filing cabinets for tool storage, with a platform for holding the shop vac. It's entirely built out of construction lumber to keep the cost at a minimum.

A tool well is added to the back to make it easy to clear up your work surface while in the middle of a project. 

10 dog-holes are placed in the front left of the bench for workholding. They are spaced every 6in, and I designed a [laser cut template](../../images/laser_template.jpg) to handle this. There will also be a Twin vise designed and manufactured by [Andrew Klein](inkleind.com) attached to the front face of the table, which will further augment workholding.

The table is just shy of 8', which might be a little long for a typical workbench. It is ~2' deep. The woodshop is very small, under 100 sqft. So going big here was a decision I perseverated over for a while, but ultimately decided having a large main workbench is the a more efficient use of space than several small tables.

## Conclusion
Overall, I'm very satisfied with how sturdy the table is. The finish color is OK (used Danish oil), and I think it being made of Douglass Fir, it's going to get pretty dented up. We will see how it wears. At least I know how to repair it. I use a track saw a lot, and I really think the track saw begs for something that's not up against a wall. because the track needs some overhang. I'm looking forward to adding the vise, because I think it will make this a great bench for hand tool work, power carving, etc.

## What's Next
I think the next thing is going to be two portable square tables that will be placed on quality casters. Then if you need more space, just roll them out of the room. If you need more worktop, bring 'em back in.
