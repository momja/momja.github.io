# My Favorite Things of 2024

Every year, the Tested network publishes a series of videos with the staff about their favorite things of the year. Here's all the ones from 2024:
- [Norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12uvJkBL7mo)
- [Josh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_88zIuh_xY&pp=ygUOVGVzdGVkIGluIDIwMjQ%3D)
- [Adam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgrt7uoGm70&pp=ygUOVGVzdGVkIGluIDIwMjQ%3D)
- [Kayte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2sBYsaW8h4&pp=ygUOVGVzdGVkIGluIDIwMjQ%3D)
- [Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhvq9M2TCjU&pp=ygUOVGVzdGVkIGluIDIwMjQ%3D)
- [Joey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_J1wXFXBoo&pp=ygUOVGVzdGVkIGluIDIwMjQ%3D)
I really enjoy these videos. I'm a bit of a tool nerd, so it's a real treat seeing professionals describe some of the tools that have been the most satisfying and productive to use. I think the tools in someone's metaphorical tool belt also say a lot about that person's philosophy of work.

So I thought I should share some my favorite things from 2024! It's not all tools, but a lot of them are.

None of these are affiliate links BTW.

## My Favorite Things of 2024
- [Knipex Cobra Water Pump Pliers](https://www.knipex.com/products/pipe-wrenches-and-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/8703180?v=9365). I actually received a pair of these last Christmas, used them for a bit, then I lost them :(. Halfway through 2024, I bought a replacement. I had the [4 inch](https://a.co/d/75JYw9D), then I replaced with the [5 inch](https://a.co/d/a1aPUr3) ones. Both are great, I kind of wish I still had the 4 inchers, since they do not use a push button mechanism to release the jaws, and they are just a little more pocketable. I shuttle my stuff between home and [Sequoia Fabrica](https://sequoiafabrica.org) by bike frequently, so having small tools is really convenient. The pliers themselves are fantastic, they can get a grip on anything, and their unique shape helps prevent rounding over bolt heads.
- [Spiral Shank Flush Template Router Bit](https://www.banggood.com/12_7+25_4+67MM-Carbide-Lower-Bearing-Spiral-Trimming-CNC-Router-Bit-End-Mill-1-or-4-inch-6_35mm-Shank-for-Woodworking-p-2000463.html?cur_warehouse=CN&rmmds=search). Template bits in general have become a new favorite item for me. Along with a laser cutter (or a steady hand at the bandsaw), it has become a total joy to make templates. I'm working on a sign (more on that later), where I had to route out every letter individually. This wouldn't have been possible freehand, but with a palm router, a template bit, and a template, it was a breeze. It's really unlocked new possibilities for me, especially in a small shop.
- [Makita Cordless Track Saw](https://a.co/d/3LE3lVz). I think any track saw would make me just as excited, but this is the one I got. I bought it used off Craigslist, and it took a little adjusting and getting used to, but this machine is fantastic. In a woodshop without a table saw, it's practically required. My biggest frustration is having to set it up and tear it down every time I use it. However, there are some cool things you can buy or [make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHj5G6t1qvY&pp=ygUUdHJhY2sgc2F3IHJhaWwgaGluZ2U%3D) (or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59RAkriXEh0&pp=ygUUdHJhY2sgc2F3IHJhaWwgaGluZ2U%3D)) that allow for some easier setup and alignment with the track saw, which I hope to find some time to figure out in 2025.
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). Nextcloud is my self-hosted solution to file storage. It's like Google Drive, but I can host _everything_ myself, so there's no question of data ownership, and I have complete control over who can see it, and how I access it.
- [IOS Background Sounds](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/play-background-sounds-iphb2cfa052c/ios). This one might seem a little weird, but always having white noise on my device, without having to fiddle with an app or make sure it's downloaded, is absolutely fantastic. I have [tinnitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus), so whether I'm home or away, having white noise is a necessity when I sleep. For whatever reason, I've been woefully unimpressed with the market of white noise apps available. [Portal](https://portal.app/) is the best I've seen, but I don't want to pay for a subscription since I only use the most basic functions (But if you like it _you_ should buy it! I met [Nick](https://portal.app/about), their founder once, and they are a great person making a great product).

Alright so that's the cut for 2024. Maybe I'll do this again at the end of the year/start of next year.
