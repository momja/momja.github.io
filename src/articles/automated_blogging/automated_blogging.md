# Automated Blog Publishing
Previously, I wrote a blog post about deploying my blog with Github Pages. Now, I want to be able to write blog posts from my phone and publish them without touch git. So I thought it would be neat if I could edit the files on my iPhone by connecting to one of my always-on raspberry pi's, and automate the deployment of the blog from the raspberry pi. If this works, I'll write more about it. I'm still testing things out, and I'm trying to get [watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) to handle the watching for me. If this post is live though, the automated publish worked!
