# Thoughts on Teaching Others
These are some incantations I tell myself when I feel like I'm not good enough to teach others how to do something.
- You don't need to know all the answers, you just need to be one step ahead.
- You don't need to be an expert.
- Be honest when you don't know something, and try to figure it out together.
- You will learn as much from students as the students learn from you.
- Each time you try, you will do it a little better.
- People come to learn. Don't trick yourself into thinking they don't want to be there.
- "Give it away and you get all." (This is a theme from the book [Home Baked](https://bookshop.org/p/books/home-baked-my-mom-marijuana-and-the-stoning-of-san-francisco-alia-volz/11781256?ean=9780358505020&next=t&next=t).
- Always be learning.
- Just try your best.
