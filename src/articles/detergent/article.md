# Homemade Laundry Detergent for Lazy People

- **2** parts Borax (400g)
- **2** parts Washing Soda (400g)
- **1** parts Fels-Naptha Soap (200g)
## Steps
1. Grind 200g of Fels-Naptha soap with an old coffee grinder. Anything works really as long as you can get it down to powder.
2. Add 400g of Washin Soda, and 400g of Borax to a plastic container
3. Seal the container and shake to mix
4. Use about 2 tablespoons per load

## Notes
- Iâ€™ve tried using Zote soap, another popular laundry soap, but its way to hard to grind into a powder. The soap is not nearly as dry as fels naptha, the texture is slightly oily.
