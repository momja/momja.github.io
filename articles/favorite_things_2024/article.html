<h1>My Favorite Things of 2024</h1>

<p>Every year, the Tested network publishes a series of videos with the staff about their favorite things of the year. Here's all the ones from 2024:</p>

I really enjoy these videos. I'm a bit of a tool nerd, so it's a real treat seeing professionals describe some of the tools that have been the most satisfying and productive to use. I think the tools in someone's metaphorical tool belt also say a lot about that person's philosophy of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I thought I should share some my favorite things from 2024! It's not all tools, but a lot of them are.</p>

<p>None of these are affiliate links BTW.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Things of 2024</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.knipex.com/products/pipe-wrenches-and-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/8703180?v=9365">Knipex Cobra Water Pump Pliers</a>. I actually received a pair of these last Christmas, used them for a bit, then I lost them :(. Halfway through 2024, I bought a replacement. I had the <a href="https://a.co/d/75JYw9D">4 inch</a>, then I replaced with the <a href="https://a.co/d/a1aPUr3">5 inch</a> ones. Both are great, I kind of wish I still had the 4 inchers, since they do not use a push button mechanism to release the jaws, and they are just a little more pocketable. I shuttle my stuff between home and <a href="https://sequoiafabrica.org">Sequoia Fabrica</a> by bike frequently, so having small tools is really convenient. The pliers themselves are fantastic, they can get a grip on anything, and their unique shape helps prevent rounding over bolt heads.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/12_7+25_4+67MM-Carbide-Lower-Bearing-Spiral-Trimming-CNC-Router-Bit-End-Mill-1-or-4-inch-6_35mm-Shank-for-Woodworking-p-2000463.html?cur_warehouse=CN&rmmds=search">Spiral Shank Flush Template Router Bit</a>. Template bits in general have become a new favorite item for me. Along with a laser cutter (or a steady hand at the bandsaw), it has become a total joy to make templates. I'm working on a sign (more on that later), where I had to route out every letter individually. This wouldn't have been possible freehand, but with a palm router, a template bit, and a template, it was a breeze. It's really unlocked new possibilities for me, especially in a small shop.</li>
<li><a href="https://a.co/d/3LE3lVz">Makita Cordless Track Saw</a>. I think any track saw would make me just as excited, but this is the one I got. I bought it used off Craigslist, and it took a little adjusting and getting used to, but this machine is fantastic. In a woodshop without a table saw, it's practically required. My biggest frustration is having to set it up and tear it down every time I use it. However, there are some cool things you can buy or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHj5G6t1qvY&pp=ygUUdHJhY2sgc2F3IHJhaWwgaGluZ2U%3D">make</a> (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59RAkriXEh0&pp=ygUUdHJhY2sgc2F3IHJhaWwgaGluZ2U%3D">this</a>) that allow for some easier setup and alignment with the track saw, which I hope to find some time to figure out in 2025.</li>
<li><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>. Nextcloud is my self-hosted solution to file storage. It's like Google Drive, but I can host <em>everything</em> myself, so there's no question of data ownership, and I have complete control over who can see it, and how I access it.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/play-background-sounds-iphb2cfa052c/ios">IOS Background Sounds</a>. This one might seem a little weird, but always having white noise on my device, without having to fiddle with an app or make sure it's downloaded, is absolutely fantastic. I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus">tinnitus</a>, so whether I'm home or away, having white noise is a necessity when I sleep. For whatever reason, I've been woefully unimpressed with the market of white noise apps available. <a href="https://portal.app/">Portal</a> is the best I've seen, but I don't want to pay for a subscription since I only use the most basic functions (But if you like it <em>you</em> should buy it! I met <a href="https://portal.app/about">Nick</a>, their founder once, and they are a great person making a great product).</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright so that's the cut for 2024. Maybe I'll do this again at the end of the year/start of next year.</p>
