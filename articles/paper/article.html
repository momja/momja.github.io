            <p>I did a quick refresh of my website. I did some changes to the formatting, and I was also curious about how SVG noise works, so I added some texture to the background. I kind of like it, although I think there is more tweaking required. I'm trying to go for this paper-y feel, as if it were e-ink, or well, actually paper. I really enjoy skeumorphic design in digital media.</p>

<p>While I was looking for help with SVG backgrounds, I found this really neat page called <a href="https://www.fffuel.co/nnnoise/">nnnoise</a>. There's actually a lot of great mini-tools from this creator. <a href="https://www.fffuel.co/">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I didn't figure out how to blend text with the background in a way that feels like it's not just sitting on top. I will continue to mess around with that in the future.</p>
