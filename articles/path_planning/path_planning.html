<h1>
    Path Planning : Bat Guy Vs. The Clown
</h1>
<h2>
    Max Omdal
</h2>
<p>
    This Path Planning project is an interactive simulation with several interactive parts. Primarily a superhero
    and supervillain play a game of cat and mouse. Batma... err.. "Bat Guy" and "The Clown" are caught in this
    battle. As Bat Guy, you have the ability to control bats by dropping signaling devices that they will navigate
    their way through a maze of water towers to reach. You also will need to make use of your other Super gadgets,
    like explosive projectiles, and miniature self-driving probes. Read on to learn about all the features in this
    application, as well as how it was implemented.

    Controls
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To orbit the camera, use the arrow keys</li>

        he'll track us down!</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Path Planning & 3D Rendering
</h3>
<p>
    This program uses the A* search algorithm with a probabilistic roadmap to provide a planning graph and a system
    for an agent to travel from a start position to a goal position. The obstacles in the scene are all cylindrical.
    The bats are simulated using a boids algorithm, and a global tethering point is progressed along a path. A force
    is then applied to the boids to move it towards the tether point. Because the path planning does not directly
    place each individual boid out of the way of obstacles, we also check for collisions with the obstacles to
    avoid.
</p>
<p>
    Note that while the rendering is in 3D, the path planning is still in 2 Dimensions. This reduces the complexity
    of our roadmap, and lets us approximate each obstacle/agent as a circle.

<h3>
    Crowd Simulation
</h3>
<p>
    There are two techniques used here for crowd simulation. The time-to-collision technique is used to handle
    interactions between the probes and The Clown. When The Clown isn't moving, try sending a probe to his location.
    You will see how it's path is blocked. Then, as already mentioned all bats are simulated with the boids
    algorithm. They will all successfully avoid each other and obstacles. Multiple bats can share a single path, so

<h3>
    3D Modeling
</h3>
<p>
    Most of the 3D environment was made by myself, but for the characters, I started with a base model on <a
        href="https://free3d.com/3d-model/base-mesh-ready-to-be-rigged-15483.html">Free3D made by Prodigy114</a> I
    rigged, added some materials, and gave bat guy a cloak and mask.

<h3>
    Conclusions and Future Work
</h3>
<p>
    This demonstrates several concepts of Crowd simulation and Path planning. There are some known problems.
    Sometimes, if you do not place at least one of the bat signals during each turn, it may crash the program.
    Future work on this project could involve higher fidelity animated models, using voronoi maps for the bats to
    increase their spacing between objects, and creating a response system to handle when the enemy is hit by one of
    the player's weapons.
