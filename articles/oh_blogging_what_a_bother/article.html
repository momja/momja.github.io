            <h1>Oh Blogging, What a Bother!</h1>

<p>Sometimes, I'm not so certain if I enjoy blogging, or if I enjoy the <em>idea</em> of blogging. I know I like making things, both physical and digital, I know I like reading blogs, so why would I <em>not</em> enjoy blogging? I'm not sure, but I'm starting to question it. Maybe what I really need is time away from screens after a day job spent in front of them. It's also been an awfully busy start to 2025, with some stressful national politics.</p>

<p>Maybe what I need is to get off the internet altogether.</p>

<p>I'm just not sure. And maybe that's OK too! I'm still here writing something, aren't I? What I really think I would like to have on this blog is documentation of the <em>in-real-life</em> things I've built. I see two great benefits to this. The first being a personal log of my creations, a way to reflect and consider how the quality and complexity of projects I take on changes and grows. The other is being able to hopefully inspire others to build things themselves! I see a lot of blogs about digital technology, photography, current events, and sometimes art. What about the makerspace movement? What about everyone's own personal <a href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackadays</a>. That's the type of blog I'd like to read more of. There's plenty of YouTube channels in that vein, but I don't need any more video in my life! I don't need to tell you, dear reader, that YouTube and blogging are far from the same thing.</p>

<p>Do you have any blogs to recommend to me?</p>
